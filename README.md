War-Card-Game is a browser recreation of the classic War Card Game. Each time a turn is played the players pull a card from their deck and compare it with one another, whoever has the highest value card gets to keep both!  
The goal of the game is to obtain the entirety of the cards available, by comparing them all.  

If both players have a card with the same value they go into war mode where each one draws three cards face down and a fourth one face up. They now compare the value of their fourth cards; whoever has the highest value card keeps all of the cards used in war. If their fourth card also results in a tie the war is repeated and all of the previous war cards are available to keep.
